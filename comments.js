// this is an example of using git in the work flow:

// 1. I write one part of the code
// 2. another developer add his part
// 3. we merge our work together

//Problems that git solves:

// 1. You can always go back to the code before the latest changes were made
// 2. Each software engineer work in his local environment without the need of a server

// Fix the bug!
